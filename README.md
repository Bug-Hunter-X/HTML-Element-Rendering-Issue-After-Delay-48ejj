This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to element rendering.  The bug occurs when an element's content is removed using innerHTML = "", and its display style is set to "none". Subsequently, after a delay, the content is restored and the display style is set back to "block".  This can lead to rendering issues or flickering in some browsers. The solution provides an alternative approach to avoid this issue.
